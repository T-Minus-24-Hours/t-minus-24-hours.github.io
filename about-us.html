  <p style="font-size: 20px">The mission of T-Minus 24 Hours is to spread awareness about diseases and disabilities to
    other youth within the community. The organization aims not only to educate youth, but to inspire them to make a
    difference and to provide them with the tools and skills they need to make a difference in the world.</p>
  <h1 class="display-5 text-center">Our Story</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 18px">T-Minus 24 Hours was started in early February of 2022 by co-founders Athmik Jeyasekar, James
    Kim, and Liann Moreschi. 9th graders at the time, they wanted to raise awareness for issues within their community in
    a fun and engaging way. Enlisting the help of their peers from various schools throughout Northern Virginia, they grew
    the nonprofit organization into what it is now. Today, T-Minus 24 Hours works to inspire and educate middle and high
    school students through competition based events that help to cultivate creative and critical reasoning and
    communication skills.</p>
