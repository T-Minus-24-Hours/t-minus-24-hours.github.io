    <p>Down syndrome is a common genetic condition that is estimated to affect over 400,000 people in the US alone. Often diagnosed at or before birth, Down syndrome is a lifelong condition that can affect appearance, physical and intellectual development, and susceptibility to other health conditions. In this competition, students will be presented with a scenario about someone living with Down syndrome. They will have 24 hours to research and come up with a creative, feasible solution to aid the person in their daily life. At the end of the 24 hours, the students will present their solution to a panel of judges for the chance to win up to $125.</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Teams of 1 through 4 will be given a scenario about someone living with Down Syndrome</li>
   <li>They will have 24 hours to research possible treatment plans, technologies, and/or services that could help the individual</li>
    <li>At the end of the 24 hours, teams will present their solution in a Google Meet call (any format is fine, though our recommendation is a slideshow presentation); they should be prepared to answer follow-up questions about their solution</li>
        <li>Winners will be announced the day after presentations are given, and prize money will be given in the form of Amazon gift cards</li>
   </ul>
